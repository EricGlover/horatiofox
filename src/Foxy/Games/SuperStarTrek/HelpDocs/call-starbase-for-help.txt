Mnemonic:  CALL
(No abbreviation)

[Originally, this command was called "HELP", but these days it might
be misinterpreted as built-in documentation!]

When you get into serious trouble, you may call starbase for help.
Starbases have a device called a "long-range transporter beam" which
they can use to teleport you to base.  This works by dematerializing
your starship at its current position and re-materializing it
adjacent to the nearest starbase.  Teleportation is instantaneous,
and starbase supplies the required energy--all you have to do is let
them know (via subspace radio) that you need to be rescued.

This command should be employed only when absolutely necessary.  In
the first place, calling for help is an admission on your part that
you got yourself into something you cannot get yourself out of, and
you are heavily penalized for this in the final scoring.  Secondly,
the long-range transporter beam is not reliable--starbase can always
manage to dematerialize your starship, but (depending on distance)
may or may not be able to re-materialize you again.  The long-range
transporter beam has no absolute maximum range; if you are in the
same quadrant as a starbase, you have a good chance (about 90%) of
re-materializing successfully.  Your chances drop to roughly 50-50 at
just over 3 quadrants.
