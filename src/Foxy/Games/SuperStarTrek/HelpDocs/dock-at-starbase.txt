Mnemonic:  DOCK
Shortest abbreviation:  D

You may dock your starship whenever you are in one of the eight
sector positions immediately adjacent to a starbase.  When you dock,
your starship is resupplied with energy, shield energy photon
torpedoes, and life support reserves.  Repairs also proceed faster at
starbase, so if some of your devices are damaged, you may wish to
stay at base (by using the "REST" command) until they are fixed.  If
your ship has more than its normal maximum energy (which can happen
if you've loaded crystals) the ship's energy is not changed.

You may not dock while in standard orbit around a planet.

Starbases have their own deflector shields, so you are completely
safe from phaser attack while docked.  You are also safe from
long-range tractor beams.

Starbases also have both short and long range sensors, which you can
use if yours are broken. There's also a subspace radio to get
information about happenings in the galaxy. Mr. Spock will update the
star chart if your ask for it while docked and your own radio is dead.
