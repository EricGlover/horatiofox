Mnemonic:  DESTRUCT
(no abbreviation)

You may self-destruct, thus killing yourself and ending the game.  If
there are nearby Klingons, you may take a few of them with you (the
more energy you have left, the bigger the bang).

In order to self-destruct you must remember the password you typed in
at the beginning of the game.
