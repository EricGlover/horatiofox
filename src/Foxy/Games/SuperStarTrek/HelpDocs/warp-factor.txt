Mnemonic:  WARP
Shortest abbreviation:  W
Full command:  WARP <number>

Your warp factor controls the speed of your starship.  The larger the
warp factor, the faster you go and the more energy you use.

Your minimum warp factor is 1.0 and your maximum warp factor is 10.0
(which is 100 times as fast and uses 1000 times as much energy).  At
speeds above warp 6 there is some danger of causing damage to your
warp engines; this damage is larger at higher warp factors and also
depends on how far you go at that warp factor.

At exactly warp 10 there is some probability of entering a so-called
"time warp" and being thrown forward or backward in time.  The farther
you go at warp 10, the greater is the probability of entering the
time warp.
