Mnemonic:  TRANSPORT
Shortest abbreviation:  T

The transporter is a device which can convert any physical object
into energy, beam the energy through space, and reconstruct the
physical object at some destination.  Transporting is one way to land
on a planet.  Since the transporter has a limited range, you must be
in standard orbit to beam down to a planet.  Shields must be down
while transporting.

The transport command is used to beam a landing party onto a planet
to mine "dilithium crystals".  Each time the command is given the
landing party (which you lead) moves from the ship to the planet, or
vice-versa.

You are advised against needless transporting, since like all
devices, the transporter will sometimes malfunction.

The transporter consumes negligible time and energy.  Its use does
not constitute a "turn".
