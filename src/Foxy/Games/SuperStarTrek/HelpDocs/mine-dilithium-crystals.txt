Mnemonic:  MINE
Shortest abbreviation:  MI

Once you and your mining party are on the surface of a planet which
has dilithium crystals, this command will dig them for you.

Mining requires time and constitutes a "turn".  No energy is used.
Class M planets require 0.1 to 0.3 stardates to mine.  Class N
planets take twice as long, and class O planets take three times as
long.

Dilithium crystals contain enormous energy in a form that is readily
released in the ship's power system.  It is an excellent idea to mine
them whenever possible, for use in emergencies.  You keep the
crystals until the game is over or you abandon ship when not at a
starbase.
