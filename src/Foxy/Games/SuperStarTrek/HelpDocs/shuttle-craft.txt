Mnemonic:  SHUTTLE
Shortest abbreviation:  SHU

An alternate way to travel to and from planets.  Because of limited
range, you must be in standard orbit to use the shuttle craft, named
"Galileo".  Shields must be down.

Unlike transporting, use of the shuttle craft does constitute a
"turn" since time is consumed.  The time naturally depends on orbit
altitude, and is equal to 3.0e-5 times altitude.  Shuttling uses no
ship energy.

You should use the same travel device going from the planet to the
ship as you use to go from the ship to the planet. However it is
possible to transport to the planet and have the Galileo crew come
and pick your landing party up, or to take the Galileo to the planet
and then transport back, leaving the shuttle craft on the planet.
