Mnemonic:  CRYSTALS
Shortest abbreviation:  CR

This is a very powerful command which should be used with caution.
Once you have dilithium crystals aboard ship, this command will
instruct engineering officer Scott and Mr. Spock to place a raw
dilithium crystal into the power channel of the ship's
matter-antimatter converter.  When it works, this command will
greatly boost the ship's energy.

Because the crystals are raw and impure, instabilities can occur in
the power channel.  Usually Scotty can control these.  When he
cannot, the results are disastrous. Scotty will use those crystals
that appear to be most stable first.

Since using raw dilithium crystals for this purpose entails
considerable risk, Starfleet Regulations allow its use only during
"condition yellow".  No time or energy is used.
