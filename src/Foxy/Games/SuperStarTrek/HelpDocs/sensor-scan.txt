Mnemonic:  SENSORS
Shortest abbreviation:  SE

Utilizing the short-range sensors, science officer Spock gives you a
readout on any planet in your quadrant.  Planets come in three
classes: M, N, and O.  Only class M planets have earth-like
conditions.  Spock informs you if the planet has any dilithium
crystals.  Sensor scans are free.
