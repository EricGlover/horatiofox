Mnemonic:  FREEZE
(no abbreviation)
Full command:  FREEZE <FILE NAME>

The purpose of the FREEZE command is to allow a player to save the
current state of the game, so that it can be finished later.  A
plaque may not be generated from a frozen game. A file with the
specified <file name> and type '.TRK' is created (if necessary) in
the current directory, and all pertinent information about the game
is written to that file. The game may be continued as usual or be
terminated at the user's option.

To restart a game created by the "FREEZE" command, the user need only
type "FROZEN" in response to the initial question about the type of
game desired, followed by the <file name>.

NOTE: A "tournament" game is like a frozen game, with the following
differences.  (1) Tournament games always start from the beginning,
while a frozen game can start at any point.  (2) Tournament games
require only that the player remember the name or number of the
tournament, while the information about a frozen game must be kept on
a file. Tournament games can be frozen, but then they behave like
regular frozen games.

A point worth noting is that 'FREEZE' does not save the seed for the
random number generator, so that identical actions after restarting
the same frozen game can lead to different results.  However,
identical actions after starting a given tournament game always lead
to the same results.
