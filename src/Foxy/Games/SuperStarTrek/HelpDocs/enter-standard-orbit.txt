Mnemonic:  ORBIT
Shortest abbreviation:  O

To land on a planet you must first be in standard orbit.  You achieve
this in a manner similar to docking at starbase.  Moving to one of
the eight sector positions immediately adjacent to the planet, you
give the orbit command which puts your ship into standard orbit about
the planet.  Since this is a maneuver, a small amount of time is
used; negligible energy is required.  If enemies are present, they
will attack.
