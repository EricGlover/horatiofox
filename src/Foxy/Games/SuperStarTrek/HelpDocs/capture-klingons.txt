Mnemonic:  CAPTURE
Shortest abbreviation: CA

The capture command provides a more humane way to end a battle than
just destroying the Klingon battleship with the crew aboard. Assuming
the subspace radio and transporter are working, and there is room in
the brig, this command will ask the captain of the weakest Klingon
ship in the quadrant to surrender.  If the captain agrees, some of the
crew will transport to your ship and the Klingon ship will be
destroyed. This command does take time and you will be attacked by any
other enemy ships if the surrender occurs.

When you dock, any captured Klingons will be transferred to the base
and you will be credited with the lives you save.
