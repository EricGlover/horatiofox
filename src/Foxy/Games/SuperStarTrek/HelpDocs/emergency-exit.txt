Mnemonic:  EMEXIT
Shortest abbreviation:  E

This command provides a quick way to exit from the game when you
observe a Klingon battle cruiser approaching your terminal.  Its
effect is to freeze the game on the file 'EMSAVE.TRK' in your current
directory, erase the screen, and exit.

Of course, you do loose the chance to get a plaque when you use this
maneuver.
