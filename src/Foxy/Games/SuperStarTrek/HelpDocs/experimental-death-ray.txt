Mnemonic:  DEATHRAY
(No abbreviation)

This command should be used only in those desperate cases where you
have absolutely no alternative.  The death ray uses energy to
rearrange matter.  Unfortunately, its working principles are not yet
thoroughly understood, and the results are highly unpredictable.

The only good thing that can result is the destruction of all enemies
in your current quadrant.  This will happen about 70% of the time.
Only enemies are destroyed; starbases, stars, and planets are
unaffected.

Constituting the remaining 30% are results varying from bad to fatal.

The death ray requires no energy or time, but if you survive, enemies
will hit you.

The Faerie Queene has no death ray.

If the death ray is damaged in its use, it must be totally replaced.
This can only be done at starbase.  Because it is a very complex
device, it takes 9.99 stardates at base to replace the death ray.
The death ray cannot be repaired in flight.
