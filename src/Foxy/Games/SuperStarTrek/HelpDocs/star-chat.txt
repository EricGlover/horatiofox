Mnemonic:  CHART
Shortest abbreviation:  C

As you proceed in the game, you learn more and more about what things
are where in the galaxy. When ever you first do a scan in a quadrant,
telemetry sensors are ejected which will report any changes in the
quadrant(s) back to your ship, providing the sub-space radio is
working. Spock will enter this information in the chart. If the radio
is not working, Spock can only enter new information discovered from
scans, and information in other quadrants may be obsolete.

The chart looks like an 8 by 8 array of numbers.  These numbers are
interpreted exactly as they are on a long-range scan. A period (.) in
place of a digit means you do not know that information yet.  For
example, ... means you know nothing about the quadrant, while .1.
means you know it contains a base, but an unknown number of Klingons
and stars.

Looking at the star chart is a free operation.  It costs neither time
nor energy, and can be done safely whether in or out of battle.
