Mnemonic:  IMPULSE
Shortest abbreviation:  I
Full command:  IMPULSE MANUAL <displacement>
               IMPULSE AUTOMATIC <destination>

The impulse engines give you a way to move when your warp engines are
damaged.  They move you at a speed of 0.95 sectors per stardate,
which is the equivalent of a warp factor of about 0.975, so they are
much too slow to use except in emergencies.

Movement commands are indicated just as in the "MOVE" command.

The impulse engines require 20 units of energy to engage, plus 10
units per sector (100 units per quadrant) traveled. It does not cost
extra to move with the shields up.
