Mnemonic:  CLOAK
Shortest abbreviation:  CLOAK
Full commands:  CLOAK ON
                CLOAK OFF

The cloaking device prevents your ship from being seen by any enemy
vessels.  When the cloaking device is in use, your subspace radio will
not receive transmissions, torpedoes will be less accurate, you cannot
dock, and you cannot use your warp engines. Enemy ships will get a
chance to attack you when you turn clocking on.

The Treaty of Algeron with the Romulans in Stardate 2311 prohibits the
use of cloaking devices. If a Romulan ship observes you cloaking or
uncloaking after this point in time you will be in violation, which
will hurt your final score.

The Faerie Queene does not have a cloaking device.
