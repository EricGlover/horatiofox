Mnemonic:  STATUS
Shortest abbreviation: ST

This command gives you information about the current state of your
starship as follows:

STARDATE - The current date. A stardate is the same as a day.

CONDITION - There are four possible conditions:
      DOCKED - docked at starbase.
      RED    - in battle.
      YELLOW - low on energy (<1000 units)
      GREEN  - none of the above

POSITION - Quadrant is given first, then sector

LIFE SUPPORT - If "ACTIVE" then life support systems are
      functioning normally. If on "RESERVES" the number is how many
      stardates your reserve food, air, etc. will last--you must
      get repairs made or get to starbase before your reserves run
      out.

WARP FACTOR - What your warp factor is currently set to.

ENERGY - The amount of energy you have left. If it drops to zero,
      you die.

TORPEDOES - How many photon torpedoes you have left.

SHIELDS - Whether your shields are up or down, how strong they are
     (what percentage of a hit they can deflect), and shield
     energy.

KLINGONS LEFT - How many of the Klingons are still out there.

TIME LEFT - How long the Federation can hold out against the
      present number of Klingons; that is, how long until the end
      if you do nothing in the meantime.  If you kill Klingons
      quickly, this number will go up--if not, it will go down.  If
      it reaches zero, the federation is conquered and you lose.

Status information is free--it uses no time or energy, and if you are
in battle, the Klingons are not given another chance to hit you.

Status information can also be obtained by doing a short-range scan.
See the SRSCAN command for details.

Each item of information can be obtained singly by requesting it.
See REQUEST command for details.
