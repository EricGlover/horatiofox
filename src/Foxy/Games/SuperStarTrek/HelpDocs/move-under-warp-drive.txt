Mnemonic:  MOVE
  Shortest abbreviation:  M
  Full command:  MOVE MANUAL <displacement>
                 MOVE AUTOMATIC <destination>

This command is the usual way to move from one place to another
within the galaxy.  You move under warp drive, according to the
current warp factor (see "WARP FACTOR").

There are two command modes for movement: MANUAL and AUTOMATIC.  The
manual mode requires the following format:

        MOVE MANUAL <deltax> <deltay>

<deltax> and <deltay> are the horizontal and vertical displacements
for your starship, in quadrants; a displacement of one sector is 0.1
quadrants.  Specifying <deltax> and <deltay> causes your ship to move
in a straight line to the specified destination. If <deltay> is
omitted, it is assumed zero. For example, the shortest possible
command to move one sector to the right would be

        M M .1

The following examples of manual movement refer to the short-range
scan shown earlier.

  Destination Sector    Manual Movement command
        3 - 1                   M M -.3 -.1
        2 - 1                   M M -.3
        1 - 2                   M M -.2 .1
        1 - 4                   M M 0 .1
  (leaving quadrant)            M M 0 .2


The automatic mode is as follows:

        MOVE AUTOMATIC <qrow> <qcol> <srow> <scol>

where <qrow> and <qcol> are the row and column numbers of the
destination quadrant, and <srow> and <scol> are the row and column
numbers of the destination sector in that quadrant.  This command also
moves your ship in a straight line path to the destination.  For
moving within a quadrant, <qrow> and <qcol> may be omitted. For
example, to move to sector 2 - 9 in the current quadrant, the
shortest command would be

        M A 2 9

To move to quadrant 3 - 7, sector 5 - 8, type

        M A 3 7 5 8

and it will be done.  In automatic mode, either two or four numbers
must be supplied.

Automatic mode utilizes the ship's "battle computer."  If the
computer is damaged, manual movement must be used.

If warp engines are damaged less than 10 stardates (undocked) you can
still go warp 4.

It uses time and energy to move.  How much time and how much energy
depends on your current warp factor, the distance you move, and
whether your shields are up.  The higher the warp factor, the faster
you move, but higher warp factors require more energy.  You may move
with your shields up, but this doubles the energy required.

You can move within a quadrant without being attacked if you just
entered the quadrant or have bee attacked since your last move
command.  This enables you to move and hit them before they
retaliate.
